# Next.js Startup Template Boilerplate

This is a starter template for building web applications with Next.js. It includes essential configurations and a basic project structure to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for building fast and efficient web applications.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling your application.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis for identifying and fixing code issues.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
- **Husky**: Git hooks for code linting and formatting on pre-commit.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for writing and running unit tests.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-startup-template.git
   cd nextjs-startup-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start your Next.js development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Open your code editor and start building!**

   You can find the main application code in the `pages` directory, and the global styles in the `styles` directory. Customize and expand on these as needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- **`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`**: Starts the development server.

- **`npm run build` or `yarn build`**: Builds the application for production.

- **`npm start` or `yarn start`**: Starts the application in production mode after building.

- **`npm test` or `yarn test`**: Runs Jest tests for your application.

- **`npm run lint` or `yarn lint`**: Runs ESLint to identify and fix code issues.

- **`npm run format` or `yarn format`**: Runs Prettier to format your code.

## Customization

This template provides a solid starting point for your Next.js project, but you can customize it further to suit your needs. Here are a few common areas to consider:

- **Styling**: You can customize the global styles in the `styles` directory and add your own styles as needed.

- **Routing**: Next.js provides a flexible routing system. You can modify and expand the routing in the `pages` directory.

- **State Management**: Depending on your application's complexity, you may want to integrate a state management library like Redux or React Context API.

- **API Integration**: You can fetch data from APIs and integrate them into your components.

- **Testing**: Add more unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
